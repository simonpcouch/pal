\description{
The pal addin allows users to interactively select a pal to
interface with the current selection. \strong{This function is not
intended to be interfaced with in regular usage of the package.}
To launch the pal addin in RStudio, navigate to \code{Addins > Pal}
and/or register the addin with a shortcut via
\verb{Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts > Search "Pal"}—we suggest \code{Ctrl+Cmd+P}
(or \code{Ctrl+Alt+P} on non-macOS).
